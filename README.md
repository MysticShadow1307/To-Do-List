# To-Do-List
This is my personal project respository for my Capstone Seminar. This repository is mean to be updated weekly in order to track my progress throughout the project in question. The project is for my To-Do List that I am developing using a MEAN stack and some other tools in order to make a graphical user interface, a backend storage or database, include a Create, Read Update and Deletion prompt/execution (CRUD) and lastly have some form of API interaction. This is being spearheaded by Brian Hitchcock. This description may be subjected to expansion/reclarification at a later time.
